# ArduinoWebsocketClient, an Arduino client for connecting and messaging with Websockets
Blog: [World Domination Using Arduinos And Websockets](http://kevinrohling.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/world-domination-using-arduinos-and-websockets)

Websockets currently provide a simple and lightweight way to send and receive messages from web browsers.  This project was developed to extend this capability to embedded devices (Arduinos).  It is my hope that allowing devices to easily send information about themselves as well as respond to messages received from hosted services will result in some interesting applications.

## Caveats

This library doesn't support every inch of the Websocket spec, most notably the use of a Sec-Websocket-Key.  Also, because Arduino doesn't support SSL, this library also doesn't support the use of Websockets over https.  If you're interested in learning more about the Websocket spec I recommend checking out the [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).  Now that I've got that out of the way, I've been able to successfully use this to connect to several hosted Websocket services, including: [echo.websocket.org](http://websocket.org/echo.html) and [pusherapp.com](http://pusherapp.com).

## Installation instructions

Once you've cloned this repo locally, copy the ArduinoWebsocketClient directory into your Arduino Sketchbook directory under Libraries then restart the Arduino IDE so that it notices the new library.  Now, under File\Examples you should see ArduinoWebsocketClient.  To use the library in your app, select Sketch\Import Library\ArduinoWebsocketClient.

## How To Use This Library

```
byte mac[] = { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xFE, 0xED };
char server[] = "echo.websocket.org";
WebSocketIOClient client;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Ethernet.begin(mac);
  client.connect(server);
  client.setDataArrivedDelegate(dataArrived);
  client.send("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  client.monitor();
}

void dataArrived(WebSocketIOClient client, String data) {
  Serial.println("Data Arrived: " + data);
}
```

## Extension to cover SocketIO

This is an adaptation to the original Web Sockets library written by Kevin Rohling in order to accomodate some of the differences of SocketIO to the usual Web Sockets. There will be some refinement to this over time.
